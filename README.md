# code-quiz

This code quiz consists of ten questions.

Upon clicking the "Start Quiz" button, a 30 second timer starts and the quiz is initiated. 

If a question is not answered, the user will receive an alert and will not be able to proceed.

Upon submitting an answer, the next question is prompted and below, the result of the previous question, either "Correct" or "Incorrect", is displayed.

If an answer is correct, "1" point is added to the "Score".

If an answer is "Incorrect", "5" seconds are deducted from the timer.

Once all 10 questions are answered or once the timer = "0" seconds, the quiz will be terminated and a prompt will appear displaying the final score and a text input field where the user may enter a "Player Name". 

Upon clicking submit, a "Highest Scores" window is displayed with all previously saved scores and listed from highest to lowest. Here a "Clear Scores" button clears all previous entries and a "Start Over" button restarts the quiz.
